GAME STATE:
The game state is encoded using a dictionary format to hold the game's core variables:

gamestate = {'name': 'unnamed', 'age': 0, 'tod': 0, 'hcap': 100, 'health': 100, 'hunger': 100, 'ammonia': 0, 'foodInTank': 0}
    
name       - Holds the name of the current triops
age        - Age of the triops in days
tod        - "Time Of Day"; number of ticks since the current day started
hcap       - "Health Cap"; the maximum health the triops can attain under current conditions
health     - the current health of the triops
hunger     - how "full" the triops is, food-wise. A lower value indicates the triops is hungry
ammonia    - how much ammonia is currently in the tank
foodInTank - how much food is in the tank

Game state is written to the file "etriops.sav" periodically, as well as on quitting the program. The program will attempt to load the game state from this file upon starting.
